# About

Hi and welcome to WWW SQL Designer! This tool allows you to draw and create database schemas (E-R diagrams) directly in browser, without the need for any external programs (flash). You only need JavaScript enabled.
The Designer works perfectly in Chrome, Mozilla (Firefox, Seamonkey), Internet Explorer, MS Edge, Safari and Opera.

Many database features are supported, such as keys, foreign key constraints, comments and indexes. You can either save your design (for further loading & modifications), print it or export as SQL script. It is possible to retrieve (import) schema from existing database.

WWW SQL Designer was created by [Ondrej Zara](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/) and is built atop the [oz.js](http://code.google.com/p/oz-js/) JavaScript module. It is distributed under New BSD license.

Good news: A new version of WWW SQL Designer, rewritten from scratch, is now available. It has many new features, including bezier connectors, support for various customizations, localization, options and more.

Bad news: This new version is not backwards compatible with 1.x, so all old localizations and XSLT templates won't work with 2.x. Sorry for inconvenience :/
